        Machine Learning involves the use of data by computer sysytems to make 
        inferences based on the provided data while the environment is all
        what surrounds a person, animal or plant. This brings up questions like
        why and how should this seamingly unrelated fields be used together?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us start with the question of why?
        </p>
        <p>
         On February 8 2020 Antarctica recorded their highest temperatures yet 
         as verified by the UN Meteorological Organization, in an article published by Douglas 
         Main on February 6 2020 bumblebees are going extinct in a time of climate chaos, fireflies
         going extinct and thwaites, the biggest glacier, is melting at an alarming rate.
         With the recent global events it is evident that the environment is like a house of cards
         where if we keep on taking pieces out shall come crumbling down. But there is hope for the world,
         human beings have come a long way in being able to collect data, structure and model it using
         machine systems to make predictions creating early warning systems that help us to be better
         prepared and take evasive measures where possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The applications of machine learning in the environment are endless. Let us take an example of
        The Mara Elephant Project, where the kenyan wildlife rangers have collaborated with Social Good of
        Intel and The Resolve NGO to develop trail guard, which is an early warning sysytem to help arrest
        poachers. The Mara Elephant Project is one of success story among several others which provides hope.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Another example is NOTCO, an organization based in Santiago Chile, which is using Giuseppe AI to 
        mimick the perception of people on their taste of animal based food and replace them with plant
        based food which tastes the same if not better. This is bacause animals reared especially for 
        consumption account for most of the ethane emitted to the atmosphere which leads to increased 
        global warming. These are just some of the examples, with machine learning there are endless 
        possibilities on how to better coexist with the environment.
